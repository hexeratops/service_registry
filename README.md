# Service Registry

This is a side project to create a service registry. This is intended to be a low-security, simple implementation of a service registry for managing virtual machines.
This will allow a VM using simple and easy GET web reqeusts to advertise itself, any services it wishes to announce and capabilities.

Do not use this on a public network, it is purely intended to be used internally for management purposes. It does not even support TLS yet.
